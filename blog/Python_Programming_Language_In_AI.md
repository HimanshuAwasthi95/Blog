# Python Programming Language in AI

We all are in the era of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Tech giants like Google , Microsoft & Facebook investing in AI. **Amazon's Alexa** also shows the how tight compition going in to markeet of AI, not only Google & Apple but other companies also dominate the tech market if they have power of AI. There is huge opportunity in 2018 for people who looking for jobs in Machine Learning , Deep Learning & AI . Some times it seem like Machine Learning & AI both are same thing but actully their is a basic difference b/w them & In short, the best explanation defines this in better way is that:

> Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”.

Here I'm going to tell you about how a programming language plays a key roll in production of AI product & Thats true I'm talking about [Python](https://www.python.org/). If you looking for a oppportunity in AI, you must understand the power of Python.

### 1. About Python

Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented and most popular open source programming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).
It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time. 

Python is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development (like: Django, Flask & Web2py), scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D). 

If you are beginner you can easily start with python.there is Huge Python Learning resource available on Internet. I suggest few books if you really don't know any thing about Python :

1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy.pdf)
2. [Python for you and me](https://kushaldas.in/details/pym.pdf)
### 2. Python Library & Framework for AI

In this section, we will be looking at powerful, popular Python libraries that are used for artificial intelligence. We will be loooking at their pros and cons, and their features. So, Let's begin and explore these fantastic Python libraries:
