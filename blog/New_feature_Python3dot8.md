# New Features of Python 3.8

Hey Everyone,

Finally I switched to more advance & modern code-base of Python Language which is Python 3.8. *Python 3.8* was released on 
October 14th, 2019. We all know Python is one of the widely used language which can be used for Automation,
Machine Learning, Web Development  etc.
Being a Linux user I never feel to update or change version of Python or other application because every update of 
Linux come up with proper stable version of most of the application specially Python & GCC.

`So Why I switched to Python 3.8 ?`

Because I read the official documentation of Python 3.8 & believe me I can't stop my self to use these features.
Python 3.8 is introduced you some beautiful new syntax, memory sharing, more efficient serialization and de-serialization,
new Modules, improved modules, and a lot of cool changes & add-ons.
